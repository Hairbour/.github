# Privacy Policy for Hairbour

_Last updated: November 19, 2025_

Hairbour (“we”, “our”, or “us”) is a haircut simulation app that helps you visualize different hairstyles using your own photos.  
We take your privacy seriously and are committed to handling your data in a safe and transparent way.

---

## 1. Information We Collect

### Photos You Provide
To generate haircut simulations, Hairbour may ask you to provide or capture a photo of your face.

- The photo is **used only for processing the haircut simulation**.
- The photo is **sent to our server temporarily** for processing (if server-side processing is used).
- We **do not store your photos** after the simulation process is completed.
- We **do not use your photos** to train AI models, build profiles, or for any other secondary purpose.

### Technical Information (Optional / Minimal)
We may collect minimal technical information for diagnostics and performance (for example, anonymized logs or error reports).  
This information does **not** include your photos or any content of your images.

---

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information you provide **only to**:

1. Process your photo to generate haircut simulations.
2. Display the result back to you in the app.
3. Improve app stability and performance (using anonymized technical data, if any).

We **do not**:

- Sell your data.
- Share your photos with advertisers.
- Use your photos for marketing without your explicit consent.

---

## 3. Photo Processing & Storage

- Photos are processed **only for the duration needed** to generate the hairstyle preview.
- After processing, photos are **not stored** on our servers.
- We **do not store user photos or personal data in GitHub** or any source control repository.

Your simulation results are generated on the fly and not kept as a permanent record by us.

---

## 4. Third-Party Services

If we use any third-party services (e.g., hosting providers or analytics), they will only receive the minimum necessary data to deliver the app’s functionality.

We do **not** upload or store your personal data or photos in public code repositories such as GitHub.

---

## 5. Data Retention

Because we do not persistently store your photos, there is generally **no personal photo data to delete** after processing is complete.

Any technical logs that may be collected are anonymized where possible and retained only as long as necessary for app maintenance and improvement.

---

## 6. Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have rights regarding your personal data, such as:

- The right to know what data we process.
- The right to request correction or deletion of any identifiable data (if applicable).
- The right to contact us with privacy-related questions.

Since we do not store your photos, there is typically no ongoing image data associated with you after your session.

---

## 7. Children’s Privacy

Hairbour is not specifically directed at children under 13.  
If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has submitted personal data to us, please contact us so we can address it appropriately.

---

## 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.  
When we do, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this page.

We encourage you to review this page periodically to stay informed about how we handle your data.
